With the presented implementation of Shila, a shim layer between MPTCP and SCION, the combined use of the two promising technologies becomes possible. TCP applications can now be operated via SCION without any changes being necessary. If the endpoints furthermore support MPTCP, the applications also benefit from the advantages of using multiple paths orchestrated by MPTCP and inherently supported by SCION. With its prototype character, the implementation of Shila does not achieve the same performance as comparable approaches yet. However, with the development and improvement options we have identified for Shila, we were able to illustrate the potential of this approach and provide the groundwork for future research dedicated to close the performance gap. Even if it is only a tiny piece of the mosaic in SCION's ultimate goal: We are pleased with the contribution made in developing Shila for a more reliable, fairer and safer internet.
