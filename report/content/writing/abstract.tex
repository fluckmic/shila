The presented work relies on the two technologies MPTCP and SCION. Multipath TCP {\footnotesize (MPTCP)} is an extension to the Transmission Control Protocol {\footnotesize (TCP)}. Instead of a single TCP connection, MPTCP creates several connections, so-called flows, for data exchange. An approach that has recently become increasingly popular, fitting the needs of today's multihomed devices. SCION is an Internet architecture, designed to address the weaknesses and shortcomings of today's Internet. It is a secure architecture implementing path transparency as an important feature. In contrast to the current Internet, SCION gives both the transmitter and receiver control and knowledge of the paths along which their data is exchanged. 

In this thesis, we present the implementation and evaluation of Shila, an approach to combine these two technologies. With this name-giving shim layer, the use of TCP applications over the SCION network becomes possible. Thanks to Shila, the large number of such TCP applications can be tested via SCION without the need to change its implementation. If hosts support MPTCP, one also benefits from its advantages and the inherent support of multiple paths in SCION. For example, Shila allows the paths for the individual MPTCP flows to be selected according to different criteria, such as being as short as possible. 

Our implementation uses virtual network interfaces for the interaction between Shila and applications. Created during startup offers each virtual interface the possibility for a single flow of an MPTCP connection. For data exchange between Shila instances on different hosts, backbone connections via the SCION network are set up once a TCP connection is about to happen. If a client binds to one of the virtual interfaces to establish a new TCP connection, the IP traffic is intercepted by Shila. The SCION address of the host running the server is determined using the TCP address extracted from the received datagram and a hardcoded mapping. Shila contacts its counterpart on the receiving side via a dedicated endpoint listening at this SCION address and a well-known port. A backbone connection for data exchange is established and the so-called main is assigned to the corresponding TCP connection. MPTCP now starts to initiate further flows via each additional available virtual interface. Linked with its main flow, Shila has all the information necessary to set up individual backbone connections for these sub-flows accordingly.
 
The evaluation of the performance in the SCIONLab has shown that the throughput can be increased by using multiple paths. Compared to the implementation of QUIC via SCION, the presented approach performs worse. The multiple detours through the kernel caused by the use of virtual interfaces reduce the performance. In addition, sending redundant information via the backbone connection causes an unnecessarily high overhead. 

Nevertheless, the implementation offers a basis on which a promising further development can be driven forward. In addition, sending redundant information via the backbone connection.
