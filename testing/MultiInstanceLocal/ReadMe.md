Before you run.sh, setup and start the local scion infrastructure using the 
provided Shila4.topo.

- Copy Shila4.topo into scionproto/scion/topology.
- Stop the current run (./scion.sh stop) of scion.
- Setup the topology (./scion.sh topology -c topology/Shila4.topo).
- Start a new run. (./scion.sh start)

Now you can run.sh.
